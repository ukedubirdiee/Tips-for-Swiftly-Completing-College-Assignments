Large assignments can seem daunting, but breaking them into smaller, manageable chunks can make them more approachable. Divide your work into sections and set milestones for each part.
### 4. Research Wisely
When conducting research, focus on credible sources such as academic journals, books, and reputable websites. Take thorough notes and cite your sources properly to avoid plagiarism.

Procrastination is your enemy when it comes to college assignments. Begin as soon as you receive the task to allow ample time for revisions and unexpected challenges.
